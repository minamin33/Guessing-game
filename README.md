This Python program initiates a game in which the player attempts to guess a mysterious digit chosen randomly between 0 and 10. The game allows a maximum of three attempts for the player to guess the correct number.

Description

The code prompts the player to input a number between 1 and 10 to guess the randomly selected mysterious digit. The player is given a limited number of attempts to uncover the exact number.

- If the guessed number matches the mysterious digit, the player successfully unlocks the mysterious number, and the game ends.

End Game:

If the player exhausts all three attempts without guessing the correct number, the program reveals the mysterious digit and ends the game.
